## Welcome

**Embark on my 120-day Machine Learning journey!**  

This challenge is crafted to **strengthen my foundations in machine learning, AI, and data science**, while building practical, hands-on skills through real projects and exercises. Along the way, I aim to **develop the discipline, problem-solving ability, and professional habits** necessary to succeed in a Machine Learning / AI role.  

Guided by a mentor, this is a **time-bound, publicly documented challenge** that ensures **accountability, measurable progress, and a clear learning trail** for reflection and feedback.  

Every line of code, note, and experiment contributes to **mastering the skills that matter in real-world ML applications**.

---

## Objectives

- Build **strong foundations** in mathematics, statistics, and machine learning  
- Gain **hands-on experience** through daily practice and mini-projects  
- Improve **problem-solving and implementation skills**  
- Cultivate **professional habits**: documentation, logging, and consistency  
- Create a **transparent learning trail** for review and feedback  

---

## Challenge Duration

- **Start Date:** 15 Dec 2025  
- **End Date:** 15 Apr 2026  
- **Total Duration:** 120 Days  

---


> ⚡ *Tip:* Each day folder should be self-contained so anyone reviewing your work can easily follow your progress.

---

## How to Navigate

- Each **week folder** contains 5–7 **daily folders**  
- Each **day folder** should include:
  - `README.md` → Goals, work done, reflections  
  - `notes.md` → Optional theory or formula notes  
  - `code.py` → Scripts, experiments, or Jupyter notebooks  
- **PROGRESS.md** → High-level daily log for accountability  
- **progress-badge.json** → Automatically updates the progress badge in README

## Progress Tracking

Progress is tracked in **three layers**:

1. **Raw Data** → `progress.json` (update daily with “Day XX” or percent completed)  
2. **Badge JSON** → `progress-badge.json` (Shields.io compatible for README badge)  
3. **Detailed Logs** → `week_n/day_n/README.md` (notes, reflections, outputs)

> Keeping these layers separate ensures clarity and maintainability.

## Mentor Guidance

- This challenge is conducted **under mentor guidance**, with periodic reviews and feedback.  
- Guidance ensures that your daily logs, code, and reflections **align with learning goals**.
