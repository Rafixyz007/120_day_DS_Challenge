# Day 04 Progress - Micro Challenges

## Date: Day 04

## 1️ Micro Challenge: The Reference Trap

**What we did:**  
Created a list `a` and assigned it to `b`. Modified `b` and observed how changes affected `a`.

**What we learned:**  
- Variables can reference the same object in memory.  
- Understanding **mutable objects** and how changes propagate.  
- Difference between **assignment** and **copying**.

---

## 2️ Micro Challenge: The Slicing Surgeon

**What we did:**  
Created a list and extracted the last three items in reverse order using slicing.

**What we learned:**  
- How to use **slicing syntax** `[start:stop:step]`.  
- Accessing **subsets of lists** efficiently.  
- Reversing lists and selecting specific ranges in Python.

---

## 3️ Micro Challenge: The Stack Emulator

**What we did:**  
Created a list, added numbers sequentially, and removed the last number using `.pop()`.

**What we learned:**  
- Lists can be used as **stacks** in Python.  
- Understanding **LIFO (Last In First Out)** behavior.  
- Using `.append()` and `.pop()` for stack operations.

## 4️ Micro Challenge: The One-Line Architect

**What we did:**  
Generated a list of squares of even numbers from 1 to 10 using **list comprehension**.

**What we learned:**  
- How to use **list comprehensions** for concise operations.  
- Filtering and transforming data in a **single line**.  
- Writing **efficient and readable Python code**.

---

**Reflections:**  
- Reinforced **list manipulation techniques**.  
- Learned about **object references and mutability**.  
- Practiced **list slicing, stack operations, and comprehensions**.  
- Strengthened skills for **efficient and Pythonic coding**.
