## 1️ Micro Challenge: The Speed Trap (Lookup)

**What we did:**  
Created a large list and a set containing the same numbers. Checked for the presence of a number in both.

**What we learned:**  
- Sets (and dictionaries) in Python use **hash tables** for fast lookups.  
- Checking membership in a **list is O(n)**, while in a **set/dict it is O(1)**.  
- Importance of choosing the **right data structure** for performance.

## 2️ Micro Challenge: The Safe Vault

**What we did:**  
Tried to access a dictionary key that might not exist, then accessed it safely using `.get()`.

**What we learned:**  
- `.get()` allows **safe dictionary access** without raising errors.  
- Useful for handling **optional or missing keys**.  
- Prevents runtime crashes in Python code.

## 3️ Micro Challenge: The Frequency Counter

**What we did:**  
Counted the frequency of each letter in a string using a dictionary and a standard for loop.

**What we learned:**  
- Dictionaries are perfect for **tracking counts** and aggregating data.  
- Reinforced **looping, conditionals, and dictionary updates**.  
- Built foundational skills for **data counting and analysis**.

## 4️ Micro Challenge: The Database Merger

**What we did:**  
Merged two dictionaries where the user preferences override default settings using `.update()`.

**What we learned:**  
- How to **merge dictionaries** in Python.  
- User-specified settings can **override defaults** easily.  
- Practical use of `.update()` for **configuration management**.

---

**Reflections:**  
- Learned **performance differences** between lists and sets.  
- Reinforced **safe dictionary handling**.  
- Practiced **frequency counting and dictionary merging**.  
- Strengthened understanding of **data structures and practical Python operations**.
